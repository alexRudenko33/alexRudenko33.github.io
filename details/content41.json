First, remember that the safe time to work at a computer is 5-6 hours a day. Since this is rarely achieved (office workers spend 8-10 hours a day at the monitor), you should take a break at least every 40 minutes and give your eyes a rest. The muscles of the eye relax best when looking into the distance. Go to the window and see what happens there. This will already be a kind of walk for the eyes. It is also a good idea to close your eyes, massage your eyelids with light circular movements, move your closed eyes up and down and from side to side. Exercise will help preserve vision and prevent the appearance of myopia.",
